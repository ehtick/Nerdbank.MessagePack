	/// If your application is performance sensitive, you should measure the impact of this feature on your application.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// This feature is orthogonal and complementary to <see cref="PreserveReferences"/>.
	/// Preserving references impacts the serialized result and can hurt interoperability if the other party is not using the same feature.
	/// Preserving references also does not guarantee that equal strings will be reused because the original serialization may have had
	/// multiple string objects for the same value, so deserialization would produce the same result.
	/// Preserving references alone will never reuse strings across top-level deserialization operations either.
	/// Interning strings however, has no impact on the serialized result and is always safe to use.
	/// Interning strings will guarantee string objects are reused within and across deserialization operations so long as their values are equal.
	/// The combination of the two features will ensure the most compact msgpack, and will produce faster deserialization times than string interning alone.
	/// Combining the two features also activates special behavior to ensure that serialization only writes a string once
	/// and references that string later in that same serialization, even if the equal strings were unique objects.
